# Price Watch Agent — implementation log

## Step 0 — Gate check (run 2026-08-13, read-only, service key)

Org: Turn 'n Slice `a24f858b-b40b-4824-bc29-8818f034d44b`.
Sample: 20 most recent invoice/statement documents → 439 line items (invoice sample),
plus a statement-only deep pass → 491 statement lines.

### Structured-field quality (all sampled lines)

| Field | Coverage | Note |
|---|---|---|
| description | 100% | clean produce names ("Tomatoes Saladette", "Onions Brown") |
| unit_price | 100% parseable, >0 | |
| quantity | ~99.8% parseable, >0 | |
| amount | ~99.8% | 1 zero/negative line |
| weight (pack kg) | 99.6% of statement lines | enables per-kg normalisation: unit_price ÷ weight |
| unit string | 7.3% overall / 5.1% of statement lines | absent on legacy statements — NOT a blocker, `weight` covers it |

### The blocker: the 2026-06-25 legacy statement backlog

16 of 17 statements (~430 lines — the bulk of all history) were bulk-uploaded
2026-06-25 09:38–09:48 and have:
- **no `supplier_id`**, no per-line `supplier`, no document-level supplier field →
  lines cannot be attributed to a vendor;
- **no extracted statement-period/date field** → the only date is the shared upload
  timestamp, so all their prices collapse onto one day;
- no `unit`, no `total_kg` — consistent with an older extraction prompt version.

By contrast, everything extracted since (5 Country Mushrooms invoices Jul 14–20 and
the JHB Fresh Produce Market statement of Jul 05) is fully structured: supplier linked,
per-line market agents ("Botha Roodt", "C L De Villiers", …), weight, unit, dates.

### Verdict

**Conditional fail, exactly the case the plan gates on.** Current Doc-U extraction is
good enough for Price Watch going forward, but acceptance criterion 4 (backfill ALL
history) cannot be met from stored JSON: the legacy statements are supplier-less and
date-less. Proceeding on attributed docs only would leave ~2 items × ~5 price points —
too thin for the ≥3-point / 60-day-median rules to ever fire.

**Recommended pre-task (bounded, not a full extraction upgrade):** re-run the CURRENT
Doc-U extractor over the 16 legacy statements (all status `extracted`, none reviewed,
originals in `storage_path` — no human work is destroyed), confirm supplier + statement
date + weight land, then backfill per plan. Requires Josh's approval; also confirm the
extractor emits a statement date (none of the sampled statements had a date field —
verify on the Jul 05 one too, which only showed created_at).

Decisions D1–D4 resolved by Josh 2026-08-13 (see plan). Re-extraction pre-task approved.

## Pre-task — legacy statement re-extraction

### Phase 1: pilot (doc 2e21f9c7, run 2026-08-13) — PASS

- Reused the app's own path: `extractDocument()` (`claude-haiku-4-5`, matches prod) +
  `resolveSupplierProfile()`; storage bucket `documents`. No repo changes; scripts in
  scratchpad; full 16-doc backup at
  `scratchpad/backup-legacy-statements.json` (rollback source).
- Recovered: per-line supplier 28/28 (was 0), unit 28/28, total_kg 28/28;
  `supplier_id` linked to existing "Johannesburg Fresh Produce Market" row;
  confidence 92→94.
- Bonus fix: old extraction contained 14 exact-duplicate lines (sum R214,860 vs the
  statement's own R150,700). New extraction reconciles to the cent. Legacy extractions
  over-count purchases — relevant beyond Price Watch.
- **Premise correction**: statement dates were never missing — `summary.statement_date`
  exists on 15/16 legacy docs (only edda8e8f is null). Backfill uses
  `summary.statement_date` for statements, extracted invoice-date field for invoices,
  `created_at` as last resort.
- Note: `ensureSupplySyncProfile` no-ops in prod (ss_supplier_profiles table absent) —
  SupplySync tables are not deployed for TnS. Irrelevant to Price Watch (D4 coexist).

### New issues surfaced

1. **Truncated per-line names** (~15–19 chars: "Botha Roodt & Ki", "R S A Market Ag",
   some descriptions). Extraction prompt already asks for de-truncation; the model
   doesn't comply. Handling: Price Watch normalisation will alias names
   deterministically by prefix-merge (≥12-char prefix match) — no Doc-U prompt change
   in this plan's scope. Architect decision, testable, logged here.
2. **Two legacy docs are status `reviewed`** (edda8e8f, b1186349) — human-signed-off.
   Excluded from the batch; separate decision from Josh required (their old data
   carries the duplicate-line over-count).
3. **Market-agent granularity**: per-line supplier (market agent) pricing differs per
   agent; keying price series only on the document supplier (JHB market) mixes agents
   and could cause false moves. Decision put to Josh: nullable `line_supplier` column
   on pw_price_points vs document-supplier-only v1.

### Phase 2: batch of 13 `extracted`-status docs — running (same procedure,
per-doc reconciliation check, auto-restore from backup on regression).

# UI Brief reskin — implementation log (branch feat/ui-brief-reskin)

- W0 `5505f4b`: design bundle imported to `.ai/design/vyso-brief/` + plans committed.
- W1 `e9979f4`: `--pf-*`/`--tone-*` token layer added to globals.css; /app shell
  wash + text de-hardcoded. `lib/platform/tokens.ts` already matched tokens
  value-for-value (design system was extracted from this codebase) — no sync needed.
  Flag: `VYSO` export in tokens.ts has zero consumers (dead export, untouched).
- W2 `a32cc60`: primitives tokenized (module-ui.tsx, ui.tsx). Visual deltas:
  DataTable hairline #F5F9FE→#EEF1F5 (spec correction), ModuleWidgetCard gains card
  shadow + 20px padding, SecondaryAction border snapped to --pf-border-strong,
  donut/ring tracks unified on --pf-border-soft. W2 agent was killed mid-run by a
  usage limit and resumed from transcript — partial edits reconciled, no loss.
- W3 descoped to login-only after hex inventory (see plan). Mass hex→var conversion
  skipped: values already on-palette; churn without visual change.
- Known pre-existing failures (NOT ours): tsc errors in lib/platform/whatsapp-ingest.ts
  (untracked WIP), lint errors in vyso-ai/*, wastewatch/*, module-ui.tsx:289.
- W3 `9d57e54`: login restyled to platform blue (the reskin's biggest visible
  change). Panel kept edge-to-edge (no card radius — architect-accepted deviation).
- W4 verification: node tests 0 fail; tsc/lint clean for all touched files
  (pre-existing failures unchanged); login visually verified in browser —
  Log in button computes to rgb(31,95,168) = --pf-accent-strong; marketing home
  provably unaffected (globals.css had zero --pf-/--tone- vars pre-W1 and no
  marketing component references them; shader hero renders normally).
  NOT visually verified: /app/* module screens (behind auth — Josh should eyeball
  a Doc-U + OrderFlow screen after login; changes there are token-value swaps
  plus three deliberate deltas: DataTable hairline, ModuleWidgetCard shadow/padding,
  SecondaryAction border).

# The Brief landing page (branch feat/ui-brief-reskin)

- `7957c8f` plan; `da882ef` Wave A: /app renders the Brief (was a redirect) —
  rail, greeting, finding cards off agent_findings (RLS reads), dismiss/restore,
  truthful evidence nouns, empty + table-missing states, POST_LOGIN_ROUTE → /app.
  Migration file committed. isMissingRelation added to db-errors (42P01 + PGRST205).
- `d194727` Wave B: chat pill wired to Finch ('brief' module via the documented
  extension point; findings serialised server-side, bounded prelude on first user
  turn; tap-a-finding prefill; inert when FINCH_ENABLED off). Live-tested signed-in:
  three streamed answers, 200s. NOT yet exercised with real finding rows (table
  empty until Price Watch runs) — tap flow verified at unit level.
- Deviations from mock (deliberate): top bar retained (rail lives inside the page);
  per-finding action buttons (draft email, trends) deferred; chat is text-only v1.
- Discovery: agent_findings table already existed in prod → Josh applied the
  migration. Remaining manual step for data: the three phase2 re-extraction slices,
  then backfill → detection → crons.

## Price Watch build (branch feat/ui-brief-reskin)

- pw(1) `7ef9beb`: normalize + detect, 34 tests. pw(2): match + observe, 36 tests
  (5.x models get no temperature param). pw(3): run.ts orchestrator + cron route +
  digest route + backfill CLI + 28 tests — 141/141 total.
- Key behaviours: matcher called once per (supplier, raw_description) ever (review
  rows are cached decisions); in-run proposed items cannot auto-link (no stacked
  guesses); dry-run writes nothing and skips the observe model; digest sends
  nothing on zero findings and has no default recipient; dedupe key carries the
  market agent and is parsed back for open-finding suppression; statement guard
  skips statements covered by invoices within 31 days.
- Env needed in Vercel: PRICE_WATCH_ORG_IDS (TnS org id), PRICE_WATCH_DIGEST_TO
  (Josh + Roberto), CRON_SECRET (exists), RESEND_API_KEY (exists).
- vercel.json: price-watch 45 3 * * *, digest 0 4 * * 1 — LEFT UNCOMMITTED
  (file carries unrelated whatsapp-cron WIP; Josh commits both together).
- BLOCKERS for first findings: (1) Josh re-runs the phase2 slices — DB confirmed
  the earlier attempt never landed; (2) re-paste supabase/agents-price-watch.sql —
  live DB has the pre-amendment schema, pw_price_points.line_supplier is MISSING
  and every point write fails until then (deliberately no degraded path: mixing
  agents would manufacture false findings); (3) backfill dry-run → live → Josh
  clears the item-match review queue; (4) env vars above.
